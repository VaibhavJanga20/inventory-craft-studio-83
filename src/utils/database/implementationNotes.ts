/**
 * Implementation Notes
 * 
 * To implement these PL/SQL commands in a real Oracle Database:
 * 
 * 1. Connect to your Oracle Database using SQL*Plus or another client.
 * 2. Execute the table creation scripts first to set up the database schema.
 * 3. Create the triggers and stored procedures.
 * 4. Create the scheduled job for daily reports.
 * 5. Test the queries to ensure they're returning the expected results.
 * 
 * For PostgreSQL adaptation:
 * - Replace DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE with RAISE NOTICE.
 * - Replace SYSDATE with CURRENT_DATE.
 * - Adapt PL/SQL syntax to PL/pgSQL syntax.
 * 
 * For MySQL adaptation:
 * - Replace DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE with SELECT statements.
 * - Replace SYSDATE with CURDATE().
 * - Adapt PL/SQL syntax to MySQL stored procedure syntax.
 * 
 * Note: Some advanced features like nested cursors may need to be rewritten
 * depending on the database system you're using.
